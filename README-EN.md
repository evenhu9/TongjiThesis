> [!TIP]
> This template is tested against **TeX Live 2026** in CI. If you encounter unexplained compilation errors locally, please first check and upgrade your TeX Live installation to 2026. Older TeX Live versions may ship package versions that are incompatible with this template.

## Usage

### Online Use

#### Using Directly via Overleaf Template

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using the Overleaf template, please check the compiler and main entry settings:
>
> - Set `main.tex` as the main entry file, instead of other files in the project (such as `tongjithesis.cls`);
> - It is recommended to use the `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX` compilers, as some compilers (such as `pdfLaTeX`) are not supported by this template.

#### Importing This Repository on Overleaf

Download this repository via `Code | Download ZIP` and drag-and-drop the ZIP file into [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

#### Compiling in GitHub Actions

Fork this repo and push to trigger CI. Download PDFs from the `Summary | Artifacts` section of the workflow run. Enable Actions first via `Settings | Actions | General`.

### Local Use

#### Installing TeX Distribution

We recommend installing TeX Live (Windows, Linux) or MacTeX (macOS) following the [official quick install guide](https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html).

#### Building the Project

We recommend building the project via the command line. Alternatively, you can use the VS Code LaTeX Workshop plugin.

##### Command Line

###### Makefile (Linux/macOS)

```shell
make all                # compile main.pdf
make ENGINE=$ENGINE all # use $ENGINE (where $ENGINE=-xelatex or -lualatex) to compile main.pdf
make clean              # remove intermediate files
make cleanall           # remove all intermediate files (including .pdf)
make wordcount          # word count
```

###### Batchfile (Windows)

```bat
.\make.bat                # the same to "make.bat thesis"
.\make.bat thesis         # compile main.pdf
.\make.bat thesis $ENGINE # use $ENGINE (where $ENGINE=-xelatex or -lualatex) to compile main.pdf
.\make.bat clean          # clean all work files by latexmk -c
.\make.bat cleanall       # clean all work files and main.pdf by latexmk -C
.\make.bat wordcount      # wordcount
.\make.bat help           # read the manual
```

<details><summary><b>Using VS Code and LaTeX Workshop Plugin</b></summary>

Install the LaTeX Workshop plugin, then **open this project's root directory directly** (the `TongjiThesis` folder — otherwise `.vscode/settings.json` won't take effect). Build recipes are pre-configured: open `main.tex`, select `Recipe: latexmk (xelatex)` from the TeX sidebar panel, or simply save to trigger auto-compilation.

### Template Configuration

#### Document Class Options

This template provides the following document class options, which can be configured in `main.tex`:

```latex
\documentclass[
  oneside,              % One-sided printing (default); use twoside for double-sided printing
  degree=bachelor,      % Degree type: bachelor (default); master/doctor reserved
  field=science,        % Major category: science = engineering/sciences (default) / humanities
  fullwidthstop=circle, % Period style: circle keeps "。" (default) / dot replaces with "．"
  fontset=fandol,       % Font set passed to ctex, default is fandol
  times=false,          % true: system Times New Roman; false: newtx (default)
  minted=true,          % true: minted highlighting (needs Python+Pygments); false: listings
  biblatex=true,        % true: biblatex+biber (default); false: bibtex+gbt7714
]{tongjithesis}

\tjbibresource{bib/note.bib}  % Specify bib files (supports multiple, comma-separated)
```

<details><summary><b>Detailed option descriptions</b></summary>

##### Single/Double-Sided Printing Options

- `oneside`: Single-sided printing (default)
- `twoside`: Double-sided printing, adjusts page margins and binding line

##### Major Category Options

- `field=science`: Engineering/Sciences, chapter numbering uses Arabic system 1 / 1.1 / 1.1.1 (default)
- `field=humanities`: Humanities (liberal arts/law/foreign languages/arts), chapter numbering uses Chinese system 一 /（一）/ 1.
- Economics & Management belongs to social sciences: numbering hierarchy follows the science requirements, and writing follows the science template. **Class of 2026 is a transition period** — students may choose either `field=science` (recommended) or `field=humanities`. **Starting from the class of 2027, Economics & Management will uniformly use `field=science`.**

##### Font Options

- `fontset=fandol`: Use Fandol font set (default)
- `fontset=adobe`: Use Adobe font set (requires Adobe fonts installation)
- `times=false`: Use `newtx` package fonts (default)
- `times=true`: Use Times New Roman font

##### Chinese Punctuation Options

- `fullwidthstop=circle`: Keep Chinese period "。" unchanged (default)
- `fullwidthstop=dot`: Replace Chinese period "。" with full-width dot "．"

##### Bibliography Options

- `biblatex=true`: Use `biblatex` (biber backend) for bibliography management (default)
- `biblatex=false`: Use `bibtex` with `gbt7714` package for bibliography management

Use `\tjbibresource{file1.bib,file2.bib}` to specify bib files, and `\makereferences` to output the bibliography.

##### Output Type (`\infotype`, set in `chapters/metadata.tex`)

- `\infotype{thesis}`: Graduation thesis; abstract heading is "摘要" (Abstract)
- `\infotype{design}`: Graduation design (software/creative/architectural, non-engineering); abstract heading is "摘要" (Abstract)
- `\infotype{engineering}`: Graduation design (engineering); abstract heading is "设计总说明" (Design Overview)

</details>

<details><summary><b>Rendering Rare Characters</b></summary>

The default Fandol font has limited support for rare characters. Download the Adobe font set from the [`fonts`](https://github.com/TJ-CSCCG/TongjiThesis/tree/fonts) branch, install them to your system, and set `fontset=adobe` in `main.tex`:

```latex
\documentclass[
  oneside,
  fontset=adobe,
  % other options...
]{tongjithesis}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Install fonts to the system font directory rather than the project root. On Overleaf, placing fonts in the project root works with LuaLaTeX but may slow compilation.

</details>

#### Code Highlighting Options

Two code highlighting solutions are available:

1. **`minted`** (default): Python-based (Pygments) with richer syntax highlighting. Requires Python with `pygments` installed (`pip install pygments`). Compilation needs `-shell-escape` (already configured in `latexmkrc`).
2. **`listings`**: Pure LaTeX, no external dependencies. Set `minted=false` in `main.tex` to switch.

If you encounter `minted`-related errors, switch to `minted=false` — no further configuration needed.
